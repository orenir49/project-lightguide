# Getting started

* This repository contains 3 python notebook files. The easiest way to open them would be through <u>google colab</u>, which has convenient access to GitHub. You could also use jupyter.

* For google colab, go to File->Upload Notebook->Github. Search for user name <b>orenir49</b> and choose branch 'master' on <b>project-lightguide</b>.

* The first notebook, <b>light_guide</b>, contains the code you will use for ray tracing and optimization of the light guide. <u>To do anything at all, run all 3 of the existing cells- and create an empty cell for your work.</u>

* The second notebook, <b>user_guide</b>, introduces 'light_guide' step by step, and teaches you how to run simulations- as well as test (relatively) simple changes to the system.

* The third notebook, <b>programmer_guide</b>, is a more detailed documentation, that also explores the basic building blocks of the existing simulation tools- if you wish to build your own functions, improve on the program, or test significant changes to the system.
